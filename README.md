# Shaking the Rust Off
Silly little platformer prototype with a 'rusting' mechanic.

## Planned Features:
- Player character that can move and jump in a world
- Player character 'rusts' over time, affecting movement speed and appearance
- Player character can jump to remove rust
- Removing rust creates a randomized particle effect
- Dynamic music depending on player character rustiness, composed by me
- Other misc sfx created by me
